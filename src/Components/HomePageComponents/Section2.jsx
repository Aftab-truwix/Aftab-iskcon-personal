              In 1965, His Divine Grace Srila Prabhupada left Vrindavan behind
              for spreading the message of Lord Krishna in Western countries. He
              entered Boston with a trunk full of Lord Krishnaâ€™s books and a
              negligible amount of money in his pocket.
              <br />
              <br />
              Initially, he struggled a lot, but within a few days, people
              started noticing him. Some curious people joined him in his
              chanting and lectures, while some started to acquire serious
              concern about his holy mission. He lived in New York until the
              year 1966.
              <br />
              <br />
              He had started giving lectures on the sacred Bhagavad Gita weekly.
              In 1966, he established ISKCON in New York City successfully.
